## Summary

- Postgres DB in Supabase
- Deployed and hosted by Netlify

## Todo

[ ] Auth. I already have Supabase authenticating against the Azure AD. I removed it from the app as I had a brief issue where the app kept redirecting to /login. If we cannot get auth working. provide a means of allowing the user to enter their name and cache it for later upload.

[ ] Add some instructions to index to explain the steps needed to:

[ ] Download the app as a PWA

[ ] Update caches so user can operate offline

[ ] Briefily summarize how to drill into the data collection

[ ] Embiggen the buttons and text so it looks better on mobile.
